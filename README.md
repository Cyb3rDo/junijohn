Junijohn
========

A very simple script to extract usernames and hashes from Juniper firewall configs.

Just point to the config file, it will extract all local user accounts and password hashes and format/output them in the correct way to run John the Ripper over them.

Nothing special, just written on the spot onsite to review some firewalls.
